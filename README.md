# Getting Started with Bison

[Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) is a general purpose parser generator. What is parsing, you ask? It's taking the rules of some grammar, and matching them to some input corpus. A good description is available at [this tutorial](http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~lgao/teaching/bison.html). I was first reading about Bison [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#Generating_parsers_automatically) and stopped short because I was overtaken with the desire to mess around to better learn about it. If Bison and Flex are essential components for understanding how a browser works, it seems important to understand them. It also seems like a perfect opportunity to dig into a little C++, since that is also something I've been looking for opportunity to do.
